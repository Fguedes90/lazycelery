# LazyCelery Project Roadmap

## Project Status
- **Current Phase**: Foundation Complete (v0.1.0)
- **Architecture**: Implemented with full test coverage
- **Infrastructure**: CI/CD, Docker, documentation ready
- **Next Major Milestone**: MVP Feature Development

## MVP Core Features (v1.0.0)

### Worker Foundation
- [ ] Implement async Redis broker client with connection pooling
- [ ] Build worker discovery and status monitoring
- [ ] Create basic TUI layout with worker list widget
- [ ] Add real-time worker status updates (1-second intervals)

### Queue & Task Basics  
- [ ] Queue monitoring with message counts and consumption rates
- [ ] Task listing with status filtering (pending/active/success/failure)
- [ ] Basic task details view (args, kwargs, timestamps)
- [ ] Search and filter functionality for tasks

### Core Actions
- [ ] Task retry functionality for failed tasks
- [ ] Task revocation for running tasks
- [ ] Queue purge operations with confirmation dialogs
- [ ] Configuration file support (TOML format)

### Enhanced UX
- [ ] Advanced navigation (vim-style keybindings)
- [ ] Help system and keyboard shortcut overlays  
- [ ] Error handling with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Basic metrics display (success rates, queue lengths)

### Polish & Reliability
- [ ] Connection resilience (auto-reconnect)
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive error recovery

## Phase 1: Enhanced Monitoring (Post-MVP)
