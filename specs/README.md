# LazyCelery Specifications

This directory contains the specifications for the LazyCelery project, organized by development phase.

## Structure

- **[mvp.md](./mvp.md)** - Minimum Viable Product specification
  - Core features needed for a useful first release
  - Focused on essential monitoring and management
  - Target: 6-week development cycle

- **[future-features.md](./future-features.md)** - Post-MVP features
  - Advanced monitoring and debugging tools
  - Enterprise features
  - Integration capabilities
  - Organized in phases based on complexity and user value

## Development Philosophy

1. **Start Simple**: Build a solid foundation with the MVP
2. **User-Driven**: Add features based on real user feedback
3. **Performance First**: Never compromise core performance
4. **Optional Complexity**: Advanced features should be optional/plugins

## Reading Order

1. Start with `mvp.md` to understand the core product
2. Review `future-features.md` for the long-term vision
3. Check back here for updates as specs evolve

## Contributing

When proposing new features:
- Consider if it belongs in MVP or future features
