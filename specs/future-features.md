## Evaluation Criteria

Before implementing any future feature:
1. Is there clear user demand?
2. Does it align with the core mission?
3. Can it be implemented without compromising performance?
4. Is the complexity justified by the value?
5. Can it be made optional/plugin-based?

## Implementation Priority

Features should be prioritized based on:
- User feedback and requests
- Ease of implementation
- Impact on existing users
- Performance implications
- Maintenance burden

## Notes

- Each feature should be implemented as a separate module when possible
- Performance impact must be measured before merging
- Documentation must be updated with each new feature
- Consider feature flags for experimental features
- Maintain backward compatibility
